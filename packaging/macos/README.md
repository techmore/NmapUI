# macOS Native Shell

This directory contains the Swift-native macOS application and its helper executables.

## Goal

Launch a normal (non-root) SwiftUI macOS app, run privileged Nmap operations through a one-time-installed helper, and support unattended scheduled scans.

### Privilege model

- The GUI app always runs as the logged-in user.
- Full nmap scans (`-sS`, `-O`, etc.) go through `NmapPrivilegedHelper` (root LaunchDaemon).
- First complete/dragnet scan (or enabling auto-scan) prompts once for admin to install the helper.
- After install, interactive and scheduled scans need no further password prompts.
- Quick host discovery can run without the helper.

### UI model

- The dashboard, scan controls, history, reports, settings, and customer workflows are native SwiftUI.
- Generated HTML and PDF reports remain available for detailed review and export.
- Legacy HTML assets are retained only where report generation or migration compatibility still requires them.

### Scheduling

- Enabling auto-scan installs `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.techmore.nmapui.autoscan.plist`.
- The agent runs `NmapUI --scheduled-scan`, which uses the privileged helper with no UI.

## Suggested Shape

- `Sources/NmapUIApp/` for the Swift app code
- `Resources/` for the app icon, Info.plist, and menu assets
- `build.sh` or Xcode project configuration for bundling and codesigning

## Build

```bash
cd packaging/macos
./build.sh
```

Or directly with SwiftPM:

```bash
cd packaging/macos
swift build
```

To assemble a launchable `.app` bundle:

```bash
cd packaging/macos
./bundle.sh
open build/NmapUI.app
```

To install the bundle into Applications:

```bash
cd packaging/macos
./install.sh
```

To install the nightly product evaluation loop as a LaunchAgent:

```bash
cd packaging/macos
./nightly_product_eval_launchd.sh install
```

To inspect or remove it later:

```bash
cd packaging/macos
./nightly_product_eval_launchd.sh status
./nightly_product_eval_launchd.sh uninstall
```

## Run

```bash
cd packaging/macos
./run.sh
```

The app is designed to present a menu bar icon, wait for the readiness endpoint, and then open the loopback UI at `http://127.0.0.1:9000`. If startup takes too long, it shows a native prompt, the menu status row changes to `Waiting`, and the main action becomes `Open UI Anyway`. If the runtime exits unexpectedly, the app automatically attempts one restart before surfacing a native alert so the backend failure is visible right away.
The bundle uses the existing `static/techmore.png` asset to generate a macOS icon at build time when `sips` and `iconutil` are available.
The menu bar icon includes a `Runtime:` status row plus an `About NmapUI` item and a `Preferences...` item for editing the runtime command and data directory from inside the app, plus `Restart Runtime` and `Open Data Folder` actions for quicker recovery and jumping straight to the mutable data location. The main action switches between `Starting NmapUI...`, `Open UI Anyway`, and `Open NmapUI` depending on backend state. The standard About panel now also picks up the bundle version and copyright strings from `Info.plist` and shows a short credits line. The status row shows `Starting`, `Waiting`, `Ready`, `Restarting`, or `Error` depending on backend state. The data directory uses a native folder picker, can be revealed in Finder, and the panel includes a `Reset to Defaults` action.

## Runtime Overrides

- In-app Preferences control the runtime executable and argument list.
- `NMAPUI_RUNTIME_EXECUTABLE` and `NMAPUI_RUNTIME_ARGUMENTS` are stored by the Swift launcher when a custom runtime is enabled.
- The default launch path now goes through the Swift-native shell in `packaging/macos/`, with the runtime command reconstructed from structured preferences rather than stored as a single shell string.
- `NMAPUI_DATA_DIR` sets the runtime data directory, defaulting to `~/Library/Application Support/NmapUI`.
- `NMAPUI_APPLICATIONS_DIR` sets the destination for `./install.sh`, defaulting to `~/Applications`.
- The nightly eval LaunchAgent installs to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` and runs `scripts/nightly_product_eval.sh --run`.
- In-app Preferences persist the launcher overrides in `UserDefaults`, so they survive relaunches. The data directory is selected with a folder picker from the SwiftUI Preferences view, can be copied with short confirmation feedback, can be revealed in Finder, can be reset to defaults, and is also reachable from the `Open Data Folder` menu action. The copy confirmation uses a short cancellable delay so repeated clicks behave predictably and is cancelled when the view closes. The copy control uses a labeled icon button, the SwiftUI fields now include short helper captions, the data directory path is shown as selectable monospaced text for readability, the Save button stays disabled until there are unsaved changes, and Reset to Defaults asks for confirmation first. If launch-at-login registration fails during save, the app now shows a native warning alert instead of silently logging the error. The status bar menu also exposes a runtime status row that reflects startup, waiting, ready, restart, and error states, `About NmapUI` for the standard app panel, `Restart Runtime` to bounce the backend without opening Preferences first, startup timeouts now offer a single native prompt with `Open UI Anyway`, and runtime exits get one automatic restart attempt before a native warning prompt with a restart action. The About panel reads its version and copyright strings from the bundle metadata and includes the short credits line.
- `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` signs the app bundle if you have a valid Apple signing identity.
- `CODESIGN_OPTIONS` overrides the codesign flags, defaulting to `--force --deep --sign`.
- `OPEN_AFTER_INSTALL` opens the installed app after `./install.sh`, defaulting to `1`.

## Notes

- The backend should stay external, not embedded.
- The runtime should write its working data into Application Support, not inside the app bundle.
- The shell should open the local loopback UI once the runtime is healthy.
- This directory intentionally starts small so the migration can grow without forcing a rewrite all at once.
